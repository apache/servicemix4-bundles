    HBase is the Hadoop database. Think of it as a distributed, scalable, big data store.

    The main features are:
    * Linear and modular scalability.
    * Strictly consistent reads and writes.
    * Automatic and configurable sharding of tables
    * Automatic failover support between RegionServers.
    * Convenient base classes for backing Hadoop MapReduce jobs with HBase tables.
    * Easy to use Java API for client access.
    * Block cache and Bloom Filters for real-time queries.
    * Query predicate push down via server side Filters
    * Thrift gateway and a REST-ful Web service that supports XML, Protobuf, and binary data encoding options
    * Extensible jruby-based (JIRB) shell
    * Support for exporting metrics via the Hadoop metrics subsystem to files or Ganglia; or via JMX
