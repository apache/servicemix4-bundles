    Jasypt is a java library which allows the developer to add basic encryption
    capabilities to his/her projects with minimum effort, and without the need
    of having deep knowledge on how cryptography works.

        * High-security, standards-based encryption techniques, both for
          unidirectional and bidirectional encryption. Encrypt passwords,
          texts, numbers, binaries...
        * Transparent integration with Hibernate.
        * Suitable for integration into Spring-based applications and also
          transparently integrable with Spring Security.
        * Integrated capabilities for encrypting the configuration of applications
          (i.e. datasources).
        * Specific features for high-performance encryption in
          multi-processor/multi-core systems.
        * Open API for use with any JCE provider.
        * ...and much more
