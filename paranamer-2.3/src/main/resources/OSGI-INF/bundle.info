\u001B[1mDESCRIPTION\u001B[0m
    ParaNamer allows you to generate and use parameter name info for versions of Java prior to JDK 5.0 and above.
    Parameter name access was scheduled for JDK 6.0, but was cancelled at a late stage as the spec-lead suggested
    the development team ran out of time to implement it. It is sadly not shipping in JDK 7.0 either.
    Sun also had misgivings about the appropriateness of the this change to Java.
    It was felt that applications could end up depending on parameter names, and that they essentially became part
    of constructor/method signatures and could never be changed if you wanted to be backwards compatible.
    The view of the authors of Paranamer is that you should be aware that parameter names may change between releases,
    and code to not depend on them.
