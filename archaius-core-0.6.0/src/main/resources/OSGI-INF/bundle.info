    Archaius includes a set of configuration management APIs used by Netflix. It provides the following functionalities:

        * Dynamic, Typed Properties
        * High throughput and Thread Safe Configuration operations
        * A polling framework that allows obtaining property changes of a Configuration Source
        * A Callback mechanism that gets invoked on effective/"winning" property mutations (in the ordered hierarchy of Configurations)
        * A JMX MBean that can be accessed via JConsole to inspect and invoke operations on properties
        * Out of the box, Composite Configurations (with ordered hierarchy) for applications (and most web applications willing to use convention based property file locations)
        * Implementations of dynamic configuration sources for URLs, JDBC and Amazon DynamoDB
        * Scala dynamic property wrappers
